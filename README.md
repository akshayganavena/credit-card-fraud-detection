# 🚀 Credit Card Fraud Detection | *Detecting Fraudulent Transactions with ML*

---

## 🛡 Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial security. This project uses Machine Learning techniques like Logistic Regression to classify transactions as legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1). It also enhances model accuracy by using SMOTE to address class imbalance.

### 🔍 Technologies Used
- 📊 **Pandas, NumPy** for data preprocessing  
- 🏋️ **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning models  
- 🔥 **Logistic Regression** for fraud detection

## ⚙ How It Works
1️⃣ **Data Preprocessing** 📂: Load, clean, and balance the dataset using **SMOTE**.  
2️⃣ **Feature Scaling** 📊: Normalize the transaction amount for better model performance.  
3️⃣ **Model Training** 🏋️: Train **Logistic Regression** model.  
4️⃣ **Evaluation** 🎯: Measure **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score** to compare models.
